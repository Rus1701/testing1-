        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Rushil Bansoodeb, and I was born on a small island called Mauritius. I studied there until I finished high school. After high school, I wasn't sure what my future goals were. Eventually, I figured out that I was good at being creative, so I decided to turn my hobbies into a career. I chose to move abroad to continue my studies, and that's how I ended up picking graphic design as my future path. I decided to join Humber College to gain skills and experience in this field, and Iâ€™m now pursuing an advanced diploma in graphic design.</p>

        <h2>What Did I Learn.</h2>
        <p>I've gained a lot of experience from my teachers, who were eager to share their insights as graphic designers. In my 3 years at Humber College, I've developed skills and experiences in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and more. I've also learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I worked at Paywise Ltd for six months, where I honed my skills in producing videos for their website and social media platforms. I also developed leadership and communication skills during my internship there. With all these experiences and skills, I believe I'm ready for this field. However, I still want to gain more experience and learn from others.</p>
